Doesn't stand on its own.

All files should be in a directory named "ancient_rome_in_britain_frontend", which is next to the "ancient_rome_in_britain_backend" directory. The build and run process of the backend repository also handles build and run of this repository.

Make sure both directories are in the same parent directory and with the correct names.
